## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT happens and WHY (plot & theme)
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to write it (no prose, specific dialogue, detailed descriptions)
- üìñ Written for story structure, not final narrative

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every arc/volume
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to this arc
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this outline from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess character motivations**: If unclear, mark it
3. **Think like a reader**: Every vague plot point should fail the "clear and purposeful" checklist
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Character motivations and goals
   - Conflict escalation patterns
   - Thematic significance of events
   - World-building details that affect plot
   - Timeline and pacing targets
   - Foreshadowing payoff plans
